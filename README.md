# Basketball-Game
This program simulates a one-on-one basketball game. The random() function will generate a random integerfrom 0 - 3. These numbers represent the shots that players will make, 0 for air-ball, 1 for free-throw, 2 for 2 Points, 3 for 3 Pointer We keep track of each player's score over the 4 quarters if the game. We are assuming that each player takes a shot in 30 second intervals.
